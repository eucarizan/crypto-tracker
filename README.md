## Project Overview

Crypto Portfolio Tracker will be a web based application where users will be able to manage their cryptocurrency portfolio. Users will have the functionality to add their crypto currency holdings and keep track of the prices.

The application will be based on a [serverless](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/serverless/what-is-serverless/) [microservices architecture](https://www.ibm.com/uk-en/cloud/learn/microservices), involving multiple web services written in Javascript, and a [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/) user interface.

You will be implementing tasks comprising of small units of front-end and back-end functionality, which will eventually lead to fully working web application.
